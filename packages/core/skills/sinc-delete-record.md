# Delete ServiceNow Records

## Task

## Instructions for Claude

### Directory Context

Sincronia commands can be run from two locations:
- **From `ServiceNow/` directory:** `npx sinc <command>`
- **From Craftsman root:** `npm run sinc:<command>` (proxy scripts)

The `delete` command requires running from the `ServiceNow/` directory directly, as it accepts flags and arguments that npm run scripts don't forward.

---

Help the user delete records from a ServiceNow instance using Sincronia's `delete` command. After deletion, local files and the manifest are automatically cleaned up.

### Command Syntax

```bash
npx sinc delete <table> [name] [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Alias | Type | Description |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| `--scope` | `-s` | string | Target scope (e.g., x_cadso_core) |
| `--sysid` | | string | Delete by sys_id directly (skip manifest lookup) |
| `--ci` | | boolean | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--keep-local` | | boolean | Keep local files after instance delete |

### Examples

#### Delete by record name (interactive)

```bash
npx sinc delete sys_script_include MyOldUtil
# Prompts for: scope (if not determinable), confirmation
```

#### Delete with scope

```bash
npx sinc delete sys_script_include MyOldUtil --scope x_cadso_core
```

#### Delete by sys_id

```bash
npx sinc delete sys_script_include --sysid abc123def456789012345678901234ab --scope x_cadso_core
```

#### Delete but keep local files

```bash
npx sinc delete sys_script_include MyOldUtil --scope x_cadso_core --keep-local
```

#### CI/Automation mode (no prompts)

```bash
npx sinc delete sys_script_include MyOldUtil --scope x_cadso_core --ci
```

### What Happens After Delete

1. **Record is deleted** from the ServiceNow instance via `api/cadso/claude/deleteRecord`
2. **Local files are removed** — the entire record directory (`src/<scope>/<table>/<name>/`) is deleted
3. **Manifest is updated** — the record entry is removed from `sinc.manifest.<scope>.json`
4. If the table has no remaining records, the table entry is also removed from the manifest

### How sys_id Resolution Works

When you provide a **record name** (not `--sysid`):
1. The scope manifest (`sinc.manifest.<scope>.json`) is loaded
2. The sys_id is looked up from `manifest.tables[table].records[name].sys_id`
3. If not found, an error is shown with a suggestion to use `--sysid`

### Common Table Names

| Table | Deletes |
|-------|---------|
| `sys_script_include` | Script Include |
| `sys_script` | Business Rule |
| `sys_ui_script` | UI Script |
| `sys_ui_page` | UI Page |
| `sys_ux_client_script` | UX Client Script |
| `sys_processor` | Processor |
| `sys_ws_operation` | REST API Operation |
| `sys_rest_message_fn` | REST Message Function |
| `sys_ui_action` | UI Action |
| `sysevent_script_action` | Event Script Action |

### Troubleshooting

- **"Record not found in manifest"** — The record isn't tracked locally. Use `--sysid` to delete by sys_id directly, or run `npx sinc refresh` first
- **"Missing required fields: table, sys_id"** — Provide the table as the first argument and either a name or `--sysid`
- **"Record not found: table/sys_id"** — The record doesn't exist on the instance (may have been deleted already)
- **"Failed to delete record"** — Check permissions. The user may not have delete access to this table/scope
- **"Local cleanup failed"** — Record was deleted on instance but local files remain. Run `npx sinc refresh` to sync
- **Deleted wrong record** — Records deleted from ServiceNow cannot be recovered unless they're in an update set that hasn't been committed. Check update set history
