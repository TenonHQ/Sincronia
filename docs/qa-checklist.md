# Sincronia QA Audit — Programmatic Verification Checklist

## Context

AI agents have been working on the Sincronia project (`/Users/dman89/Documents/Tenon/Development/Craftsman/Sincronia`). This plan defines a comprehensive QA checklist of YES/NO questions that Claude can programmatically verify by reading files, running grep/glob, and executing safe shell commands. The goal is to confirm whether the codebase meets Tenon's standards across all dimensions.

## Known Failures (from exploration)

These items are **already identified as NO/FAIL** and represent the current technical debt:

1. **1.4** — ~35+ explicit `any` usages
2. **1.5** — 4 `TSFIXME` uses in `commander.ts`
3. **2.3** — 9 optional chaining violations (ES6-only rule)
4. **2.6** — 9 files exceed 250-line max (largest: `appUtils.ts` at 757)
5. **3.5** — Command injection risk in `gitUtils.ts` via `cp.exec`
6. **4.2/4.3/4.5** — Only 2 test files, one is a placeholder, no tests for new features
7. **5.1** — ~80 exports but only ~26 JSDoc comments
8. **5.2** — CHANGELOG stops at 0.4.1
9. **5.3/5.4** — README and CLAUDE.md missing new commands/packages
10. **7.1** — 7 uncommitted files + 4 untracked items
11. **8.1** — Callback patterns in `gitUtils.ts`
12. **8.3** — Bare `throw e` in 6+ locations
13. **8.6/2.8** — Many functions use multiple positional params
14. **9.2** — Root test script is a placeholder
15. **10.3** — Dashboard lacks rate limiting
16. **10.4** — Bare `Promise.all` without failure handling

---

## Execution Plan

1. **Run each verification command/check sequentially by category**
2. **Record YES/NO for each question**
3. **For NO answers, note the specific files and line numbers**
4. **Produce a summary scorecard**: `X/50 passing` with category breakdowns
5. **Prioritize failures by severity**: Security > Runtime Safety > Type Safety > Standards > Docs
